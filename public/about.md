> A closer look at my journey, my craft, and what drives me forward.

### My Journey

My fascination with computers began early when I first used **TurtleGraphics** to draw shapes on a screen through simple instructions. The idea that a machine could follow my logic and produce something visual instantly captivated me.

In high school, that curiosity turned into exploration. I spent hours experimenting with games, operating systems, and programming. Nothing matched the excitement of my programming class. I started with **C++** and soon began automating everyday tasks with **Python** just for fun.

Toward the end of school, programming became more than a hobby. Learning algorithms made me appreciate the elegance behind the logic, and seeing them power real-world features like map navigation and text autocorrection pushed me deeper into computer science.

Around this time, I also worked part-time as a **C/C++ Teaching Assistant** at [Internshala](https://internshala.com/), helping students understand core programming concepts — an experience that strengthened my fundamentals and communication skills.

During my undergraduate studies, I earned an internship at [Kovai.co](https://www.kovai.co/) as a **Software Engineer**. I discovered my love for web development ([Testimonial](https://www.kovai.co/blog/making-software-grads-industry-ready/)) in the .NET and Angular ecosystem, contributing to [Document360](https://document360.com/) with a focus on backend performance and authentication. Following my internship, I was converted to a full-time Software Engineer at Kovai.co, where I continued improving large-scale systems and security workflows.

Today, I am completing my **Masters in Advanced Computer Science** at the **University of Liverpool**, where I have explored advanced algorithms, high-performance computing, cloud, and machine learning.

As I prepare to graduate with **Distinction**, I am looking forward to opportunities that challenge me to apply this foundation — building software that is efficient, scalable, and thoughtfully engineered.

### Tools

Over the years, I have developed a workflow that balances performance, simplicity, and clarity.  
I work primarily in the **.NET** and **Angular** ecosystem, where type safety and strong architectural boundaries help me move fast without breaking structure.

For data persistence, I use **MongoDB** when flexibility matters and **SQL Server** when consistency takes priority.  
I enjoy working close to the backend — designing APIs, tuning queries, and improving execution paths — but I also value how small frontend details can shape user experience.

My development environment is built around efficiency. I use **VS Code** as my primary editor and **iTerm** as my terminal of choice. Together, they keep my workflow fast, minimal, and distraction-free.

My stack often includes **Azure**, **Vercel**, and **GitHub Actions** for deployment and version control. I rely on **Linux** for its transparency and performance, using it both as a development environment and a learning tool.

My approach to tooling is simple: *use what adds clarity and remove what adds friction.*  
Whether it’s a debugger, profiler, or text editor, the goal is always to make every line of code feel intentional.

### What I’m Working On

I like keeping myself engaged with projects and challenges that push me to think differently and refine how I build software.  
Here’s what I’m currently focused on:

- Preparing for the [UKIEPC](https://ukiepc.info/) Programming Contest 2025 with my university team  
- Implementing blogging functionality in this web application  
- Fixing minor bugs and refining user experience on the **Verbatim** platform  
- Developing a CLI-based **Regex Engine** to deepen my understanding of state machines  

### Beyond the Code

Outside of programming, I try to stay grounded and balanced through the things I love.  
You’ll often find me laughing, staying positive, and spending quality time with my family and friends.

I’m a huge admirer of **astronomy** — I can talk about the universe, space, and the cosmos endlessly.  
The scale and mystery of it all constantly remind me how much there is to learn.

I also enjoy playing **video games**, which often inspire my creativity and problem-solving mindset.  
When I’m not gaming, I like working out and trying new cuisines whenever I get the chance.
