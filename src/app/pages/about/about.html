      <p class="font-mono">
        My fascination with computers began early when I first used
        TurtleGraphics to draw shapes on a screen through simple instructions.
        The idea that a machine could follow my logic and produce something
        visual instantly captivated me.
      </p>
      <p class="font-mono">
        In high school, that curiosity turned into exploration. I spent hours
        experimenting with games, operating systems, and programming. Nothing
        matched the excitement of my programming class. I started with C++ and
        soon began automating everyday tasks with Python just for fun.
      </p>
      <p class="font-mono">
        Toward the end of school, programming became more than a hobby. Learning
        algorithms made me appreciate the elegance behind the logic, and seeing
        them power real world features like map navigation and text
        autocorrection pushed me deeper into computer science.

        Today, I am completing my Masters in Advanced Computer Science at the
        University of Liverpool, where I have explored advanced algorithms, high
        performance computing, cloud, and machine learning.

        As I prepare to graduate with Distinction, I am looking forward to
        opportunities that challenge me to apply this foundation, building
        software that is efficient, scalable, and thoughtfully engineered.

      <p class="font-mono">
        Over the years, I have developed a workflow that balances performance,
        simplicity, and clarity. I work primarily in the .NET and Angular
        ecosystem, where type safety and strong architectural boundaries help me
        move fast without breaking structure.
      </p>
      <p class="font-mono">
        For data persistence, I use MongoDB when flexibility matters and SQL
        Server when consistency takes priority. I enjoy working close to the
        backend, designing APIs, tuning queries, and improving execution paths,
        but I also value how small frontend details can shape user experience.
      </p>
      <p class="font-mono">
        My development environment is built around efficiency. I use VSCode as
        my primary editor and iTerm as my terminal of choice. Together, they
        keep my workflow fast, minimal, and distraction-free.
      </p>
      <p class="font-mono">
        My stack often includes Azure, Vercel, and GitHub Actions for deployment
        and version control. I rely on Linux for its transparency and
        performance, using it both as a development environment and a learning
        tool.
      </p>
      <p class="font-mono">
        My approach to tooling is simple: use what adds clarity and remove what
        adds friction. Whether it is a debugger, profiler, or text editor, the
        goal is always to make every line of code feel intentional.

        Outside of programming, I try to stay grounded and balanced through the
        things I love. You will often find me laughing, being positive, and
        spending quality time with my family and friends.

        I am a huge admirer of astronomy - I can talk about the universe, space,
        and the cosmos endlessly. The scale and mystery of it all constantly
        remind me how much there is to learn.
      </p>
      <p class="font-mono">
        I also enjoy playing video games, which often inspire my creativity and
        problem-solving mindset. When I am not gaming, I like working out and
        trying out new cuisines whenever I get the chance.
